Basic git commands:

1) Create a new repo

    (from scratch)
    > cd ~/../root_dir
    > git init

    (from existing repo)
    > git clone [url]



2) Take a snapshot

    (move element to staging area)
    > git add [filename]

    (take a full snapshot)
    > cd ~/../root_dir
    > git add .

    (identify status)
    > git status -s
    > XY  filename
    X=>Staging area status
    Y=>Working directory status



3) Display differences 
    
    (staging area ONLY)
    > git diff --cached

    (working dir ONLY)
    > git diff

    (working dir VS last commit)
    > git diff HEAD

    (summary of diff)
    > git diff [--cached,HEAD] --stat



4) Record the snapshot

    > git commit -m 'ci message'
